# ScaledVisionRacerAI
This is a reinforcement leraning project which I made during my weekend just for fun. The main idea is to visualize the process of training of neural network racer car driver. The project uses PyTorch for implementing an Actor-Critic PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm with convolutional neural networks to process raw pixel input.
